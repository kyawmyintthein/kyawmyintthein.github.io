# Hello! üëã

Hello! I'm **Kyaw Myint Thein**, but most people call me **Joe**. I'm a Senior Software Engineer originally from **Myanmar** (Burma), currently living in **Sydney, Australia**.

This blog is my personal corner of the internet where I share thoughts on technology, experiences as an immigrant, life in Sydney, and anything else that sparks my curiosity.

## My Journey

I moved to Australia for opportunities and to experience life in a different part of the world. It's been quite the adventure ‚Äì from navigating cultural differences to building complex software systems, every day brings something new to learn.

## What I Do Professionally

I work as a **Senior Software Engineer** focusing on large-scale data infrastructure and distributed systems. My day-to-day involves:

- Building and optimizing data processing pipelines
- Managing Apache Iceberg-based DataLakes
- Operating large-scale Cassandra clusters
- Leading database migrations for high-traffic applications
- Creating tools that make other engineers' lives easier

### Technical Background

- **6+ years** in software engineering across e-commerce, gaming, and telecommunications
- Experience with systems handling **200+ million users** and **10,000+ RPS**
- Specialized in **Scala, Golang, Java, Python**
- Deep expertise in **Apache Cassandra, Kafka, Spark, Iceberg, and AWS**
- **Distributed Systems** and **Data Platform Services** specialist

## What You'll Find Here

## Why "Burmese Gopher"?

You might notice the gopher mascot around the site. As someone from Myanmar working extensively with Go (Golang), I thought it was a fun way to represent my identity ‚Äì a **Burmese Gopher** navigating the world of technology and life in a new country.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not debugging distributed systems or optimizing database queries, you might find me:

- **Trekking and travelling**: Exploring new places and discovering hidden gems
- **Road trips**: There's nothing like hitting the road and seeing where it takes you
- **Cycling**: Pedaling around Sydney and exploring different neighborhoods
- **Spending time with dogs**: I absolutely love dogs and can't resist saying hello to every pup I meet
- **Trying to binge-watch Netflix**: Been attempting to get back into series over the past few months
- **Reading**: From technical articles to books on various topics
- **Exploring Sydney's food scene**: Still hunting for great Asian food - Japanese is my absolute favorite
- **Planning the next adventure**: Whether it's a weekend getaway or a longer journey
