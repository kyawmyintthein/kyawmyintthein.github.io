# About Me

Hello! I'm **Kyaw Myint Thein (Joe)**, a Senior Software Engineer with expertise in large-scale distributed systems and data infrastructure. I'm currently based in **Sydney, Australia**.

## Current Focus

I'm currently working as a **Senior Software Engineer** focusing on optimizing large-scale data infrastructure and storage solutions for e-commerce technology platforms.

### What I Do
- **Lead real-time data processing efforts** by building ETL jobs, business credential pipelines, and scalable data solutions
- **Manage and evolve Apache Iceberg-based DataLakes**, enabling robust data ingestion for machine learning, reporting, and product analytics
- **Operate and fine-tune large-scale Cassandra clusters**, ensuring high availability, low latency, and seamless scalability
- **Spearhead database migrations** of high-throughput, latency-sensitive applications, powering millions of daily requests with minimal disruption
- **Build and maintain internal tools** that streamline database operations and simplify integrations for engineering teams

### Experience Summary
I have **6+ years** of experience working across diverse industries including e-commerce technology, gaming & hardware platforms, and telecommunications. My background includes:

- **E-commerce Technology**: Large-scale data infrastructure optimization and storage solutions
- **Gaming & Hardware Platforms**: Cloud services handling 200+ million users with 30+ million daily active users, building high-traffic applications with Golang, RPC frameworks, Cassandra, MySQL, and AWS
- **Telecommunications**: Platform engineering for mobile virtual network operators, implementing critical microservices like User Identity Service, Localization & Configuration Service, and API Gateways

Throughout my career, I've focused on replacing legacy systems with scalable microservices, leading complex database migrations, and introducing modern architecture patterns like API Gateways and RPC frameworks to improve performance and productivity.

## Technical Expertise
